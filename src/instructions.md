Continue to test, until the agent mode workflow
accomplishes its activities requirements.
I've loaded the high-level instructions/objectives and started a
TODO plan; next I'l identify which script or task runs the agent
against these objectives and then execute and debug it until it
satisfies the listed activities.

## Copilot Summary (2025-12-18 21:48:56)

Hl locate the detailed workflow requirements for Copilot,
window interaction (upload, wait, OCR, copy) in your
docs/config, then map them to Agent Mode and either extend
objectives/policy or the executor so those actions actually occur,
and finally re-run headless Agent Mode to verify they happen
end-to-end
I've updated the objectives to invoke the Copilot app interaction
test, enabled full send/wait/copy behavior by default in that
script, and tured on the workflow’s copilot_app_interaction
step; next I'l e-run both Agent Mode and the
Test/Gather/Assess workflow to validate that these Copilot
window activities now actually occur.
