# AI_Coder_Controller TODOs (2025-12-17)

## Now (blockers / next verification)
- [ ] Verify Copilot App clipboard-copy workflow end-to-end (copy → clipboard → write to `logs/tests/copilot_clipboard_*.txt`).
- [ ] Tune focus walk if needed using `copy.focus_moves[*].image_path` evidence (Tab vs Shift+Tab direction + max walk).

## Next (after copy success)
- [ ] Compose file to upload to Copilot app window (request info from Copilot).
- [ ] Run keyboard-only upload workflow.
- [ ] Fix any upload workflow logic errors.

## Later (requested follow-ups)
- [ ] Update Self-Improve objective file.
- [ ] Update Self-Improve upload file.
- [ ] Do the same for AI_Algorithms_2 project files (create if missing).
