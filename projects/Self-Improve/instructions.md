# Instructions — Self-Improve Project
- Software to use:
  - VSCode for editing and running modules
  - Copilot Chat inside VSCode for improvement suggestions
- Procedure:
  1. Collect metadata: list all modules (capture.py, control.py, policy.py, ui.py, vsbridge.py, main.py)
  2. Generate a txt file with module names, functions, and file system layout
  3. Upload txt file to Copilot Chat
  4. Ask Copilot: "Analyze this architecture and suggest improvements for modularity, safety, and automation."
  5. Scroll and read Copilot’s response
  6. Summarize improvements into a new file: projects\Self-Improve\improvements.md
  7. Apply improvements iteratively, updating objectives.md with new goals
- Safety:
  - Always keep a backup of original modules before applying changes
  - Log every improvement applied in logs\self_improve.log
