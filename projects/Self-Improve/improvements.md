# Improvements (placeholder)
- Suggested refactor: split vsbridge.py into vscode.py and copilot.py
- Add error handling for pyautogui hotkeys
- Improve UI responsiveness with async event loop
- Add configuration for multiple Copilot queries per objective


## PHI-4 Contingency Plan

Analyze the attached context and suggest next steps to complete the task.
Focus on modularity, safety, and automation. Then summarize actionable changes.
User question: Plan a quick refactor checklist
Context snapshot: {
  "question": "Plan a quick refactor checklist",
  "files_selected": [],
  "project": null,
  "vsbridge": {
    "delay_ms": 400,
    "dry_run": true
  },
  "preconditions": {
    "controls_active": true,

    "dry_run": true,
    "ocr_available": false
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-12-16T01:23:48"
}


Contingencies:
- Ensure VS Code is open and focused
- Verify automation window is active (controls not paused)
- Disable dry-run if ready to actually send keystrokes
- If OCR is required, install/configure Tesseract and pytesseract
- Retry sending the prompt once preconditions hold
