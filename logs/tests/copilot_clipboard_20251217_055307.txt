Here are three concrete suggestions to improve the **AI_Coder_Controller self-improve workflow**:

1. **Dynamic Error Taxonomy**  
   - Build a structured taxonomy of error types that evolves as new issues are encountered.  
   - This ensures the controller can classify and respond to novel problems without manual intervention.

2. **Weighted Success Metrics**  
   - Introduce a scoring system that weights outcomes based on importance (e.g., speed vs. accuracy).  
   - This allows the controller to prioritize improvements that deliver the greatest overall impact.

3. **Iterative Simulation Cycles**  
   - Run controlled simulations of workflow changes before live deployment.  
   - Each cycle should measure performance against baseline metrics, ensuring safe and incremental self-improvement.  

Would you like me to expand these into a **step-by-step implementation plan** with file system mapping, so they’re directly actionable in your Windows workflow?
