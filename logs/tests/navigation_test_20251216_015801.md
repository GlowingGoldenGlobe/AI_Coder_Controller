## Notes
- VS Code focus/terminal and terminal echo succeeded.
- Copilot app focus+ask succeeded.
- OCR captured 478 chars from Copilot app; content is legible but still includes some artifacts.

## Next Tweaks (Optional)
- Fine-tune `ocr.targets.copilot_app` ROI to reduce noise.
- Consider lowering `vsbridge.delay_ms_active` slightly if stability holds.
- Keep segmented recording on; cleaner enforces both age and max_keep.
