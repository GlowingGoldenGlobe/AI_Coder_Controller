## Notes
- Deferred/quiet send is in effect; no Copilot input happens during active work.
- OCR is capturing a larger, more legible snippet; ROI can still be tuned.

## Next Tweaks (Optional)
- Adjust `ocr.targets.copilot_app` ROI to improve clarity.
- Lower `vsbridge.delay_ms_active` cautiously for speed (e.g., 200ms) and re-test.
- Keep segmented recording + cleaner with `max_keep` to bound storage.
